					<p>The Museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important items. In addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace
						Museum's collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public. The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17 million pieces
						of art were stored in the Forbidden City.</p>
