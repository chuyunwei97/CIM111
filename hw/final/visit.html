					<p>The Palace Museum is housed in the Forbidden City, the Chinese imperial palace from the Ming Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty. It is located in the middle of Beijing, China. For almost five centuries, it served as the
						home of the Emperor and his household, and the ceremonial and political centre of Chinese government. </p>

					<h4>Museum</h4>
					<p>The Museum conducted a new audit as well as a thorough search of the Forbidden City, uncovering a number of important items. In addition, the government moved items from other museums around the country to replenish the Palace
						Museum's collection. It also purchased and received donations from the public. The collections of the Palace Museum are based on the Qing imperial collection. According to the results of a 1925 audit, some 1.17 million pieces
						of art were stored in the Forbidden City.</p>
