					<p>The qin, or seven-string zither, is one of China’s oldest musical instruments, and an important part of the country’s traditional culture of rites and music. In ancient times the single character "qin", which now refers to a
						number of instruments, specifically meant the guqin: from this we see its significance. We hope that through our exhibition the culture of the qin finds yet more avid listeners!
