               <h1>Coffee</h1>
               <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. The genus Coffea is native to tropical Africa. The two most commonly grown are C. arabica and C. robusta. Once ripe, coffee berries
                  are picked, processed, and dried. Dried coffee seeds (referred to as "beans") are roasted to varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor. Roasted beans are ground and then brewed with near-boiling water to produce the beverage known as
                  coffee. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world.</p>

                  <p>Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and it can be prepared and presented in many ways.</p>

               <h3>Legendary accounts</h3>
               <p>According to one legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were the first to recognize the energizing effect of the coffee plant. However, no direct evidence that has been found earlier than the 15th century
                  indicating who among the African populations used it as a stimulant, or where coffee was first cultivated. The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee when he noticed how excited his goats became after eating
                  the beans from a coffee plant, did not appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal.</p>
               <p>Another legend attributes the discovery of coffee to a Sheikh Omar. According to an old chronicle (preserved in the Abd-Al-Kadir manuscript), Omar, who was known for his ability to cure the sick through prayer, was once exiled from Mocha in
                  Yemen to a desert cave near Ousab (modern-day Wusab, about 90 kilometres (56 mi) east of Zabid). Starving, Omar chewed berries from nearby shrubbery but found them to be too bitter. He tried roasting the seeds to improve the flavor, but they
                  became hard. He then tried boiling them to soften the seed, which resulted in a fragrant brown liquid. Upon drinking the liquid Omar was revitalized and sustained for days. As stories of this "miracle drug" reached Mocha, Omar was asked to
                  return and was made a saint.</p>

               <p>The earliest credible evidence of coffee-drinking or knowledge of the coffee tree appears in the middle of the 15th century in the accounts of Ahmed al-Ghaffar in Yemen. It was here in Arabia that coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed,
                  in a similar way to how it is prepared now. Coffee was used by Sufi circles to stay awake for their religious rituals. Accounts differ on the origin of the coffee plant prior to its appearance in Yemen. From Ethiopia, coffee could have been
                  introduced to Yemen via trade across the Red Sea.</p>
               <p>The thriving trade between Venice and North Africa, Egypt, and the Middle East, brought many goods, including coffee, to the Venetian port. From Venice, it was introduced to the rest of Europe. Coffee became more widely accepted after it was
                  deemed a Christian beverage by Pope Clement VIII in 1600, despite appeals to ban the "Muslim drink." The first European coffee house opened in Rome in 1645.A 1919 advertisement for G Washington's Coffee. The first instant coffee was invented by
                  inventor George Washington in 1909. The Dutch East India Company was the first to import coffee on a large scale.The Dutch later grew the crop in Java and Ceylon. The first exports of Indonesian coffee from Java to the Netherlands occurred in
                  1711.</p>

               <p>Benguet coffee, also known as Benguet arabica, is a single-origin coffee varietal grown in the Cordillera highlands of the northern Philippines since the 19th century. It belongs to the species Coffea arabica, of the Typica variety. It is one
                  of the main crops of farmers in the province of Benguet, which has a climate highly suitable for arabica cultivation. Benguet coffee is listed in the Ark of Taste international catalogue of endangered heritage foods by the Slow Food movement.

               <p>Geisha, sometimes referred to as Gesha, is a variety of coffee believed to be originated in Ethiopia. It is considered to produce a very aromatic and floral cup of coffee and the demand for it has grown in recent years. It was imported from
                  Costa Rica to Panama in the Boquete region. It gained prominence and popularity in 2004, when Hacienda La Esmeralda entered a competition with a lot of Geisha that proved to be very unusual and distinct, attracting record prices.</p>

               <h3>Java</h3>
               <p>West Java was the region where the earliest coffee plantations were established by the VOC. The Dutch began cultivation and exportation of coffee trees on Java (part of the Dutch East Indies) in the 17th century. Agricultural systems in Java
                  have changed considerably over time. A rust plague in the late 1880s killed off much of the plantation stocks in the Sukabumi area before spreading to Central Java and parts of East Java. This variety produces distinctly larger fruit.</p>

               <p>Typica originated from Yemeni stock, taken first to Malabar, India, and later to Indonesia by the Dutch, and the Philippines by the Spanish. It later made its way to the West Indies to the French colony at Martinique. Typica has genetically
                  evolved to produce new characteristics, often considered new varietals: Criollo (South America), Arabigo (Americas), Kona (Hawaii), Pluma Hidalgo (Mexico). This variety produces distinctly larger fruit and roughly textured foliage.</p>

                  an altitude of 1500 m above sea level, which in itself is a good indicator. This variety produces distinctly larger fruit and roughly textured foliage. This variety produces distinctly larger fruit and roughly textured foliage. </p>

               <h3>Pacas</h3>
               <p>Probably the most commonly planted Arabica in India and Southeast Asia, known for its balanced cup and subtle flavour notes of mocca. Released during the 1940s, it is a cross between the Kents and S.288 varieties. This variety produces
                  distinctly larger fruit and roughly textured foliage. A hybrid between the Costa Rican Villa Sarchi and the Timor variety. Because of its Timor parent, Sarchimor is quite resistant to leaf rust disease and stem borer. It is grown in India.</p>

               <h3>Digestion</h3>
               <p>A 1999 review found that coffee does not cause indigestion, but may promote gastrointestinal reflux. Two reviews of clinical studies on people recovering from abdominal, colorectal, and gynecological surgery found that coffee consumption
                  was
                  safe and effective for enhancing postoperative gastrointestinal function.</p>
               <h3>Mortality</h3>
               <p>Additional meta-analysis studies corroborated these findings, showing that higher coffee consumption (2–4 cups per day) was associated with a reduced risk of death by all disease causes.</p>

            <div class="other fff">
               <h3>Cardiovascular disease</h3>
               <p>Moderate coffee consumption is not a risk factor for coronary heart disease. A 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people who drank moderate amounts of coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those who
                  drank
                  more than four cups a day.</p>
               <h3>Mental health</h3>
               <p>The UK NHS advises that avoiding coffee may reduce anxiety. Caffeine, the major active ingredient in coffee, is associated with anxiety. At high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety.</p>

               <h3>Parkinson's disease</h3>
               <p>Meta-analyses have consistently found that long-term coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease. Long-term preliminary research, including assessment of symptoms for dementia and cognitive impairment, was
                  inconclusive for coffee having an effect in the elderly, mainly due to the poor quality of the studies.</p>
               <h3>Cancer</h3>
               <p>The effects of coffee consumption on cancer risk generally indicate that it is safe, and with no effect or produces a lower risk of cancer. A 2011 review found that regular coffee consumption of up to 6 cups per day reduced the risk of
                  several types of cancer.</p>
